# ueg-screened-exchange

Code and data for two papers by F. Imoto. Directory names refer to the papers by content:

* **spin paper** (`spin/`, `plot_data/spin/`, `REPRODUCE_SPIN.md`): *Low- and high-density asymptotics of RPA-screened second-order exchange in the spin-polarized uniform electron gas* (submitted);
* **Mellin-pole paper** (`mpp_checks/`, `mpp_review/`, `mpp_figures/`, and the checks in `kernels_checks/` listed in its table below): *Revisiting the $r_s$ expansion of the uniform electron gas in $d$ dimensions: $\log r_s$ terms from coincident Mellin poles* (submitted), manuscript version v4.21.

`kernels_checks/`, `kernels_review/` and `plot_data/kernels/` were written for an earlier manuscript on spectral kernels and Feynman-diagram weights. That manuscript was not published. Its material was revised into the Mellin-pole paper, which uses some of these checks (SI Sec. S19). The rest is kept as a record and is listed in the section on the earlier manuscript below.

Every number, table and figure of these two papers and their supplementary material can be regenerated from this repository, either from stored raw data or by recomputation.

## Quick start

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements-spin.txt
export OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 PYTHONHASHSEED=0
PYTHONPATH=src python tests/test_all.py     # unit and contract tests
python spin/analytic_audit.py                # exact checks of the analytic results
python validation/analyze_validation.py      # SM S8-S11 summary from the stored replicates
```

The production records were written with Python 3.12.14, NumPy 2.3.5 and SciPy 1.17.0. `production/verify.py` and `production/compute.py` refuse other interpreter versions before writing results. Run scripts from the repository root (the `validation/` scripts change to it themselves).

## Earlier kernels manuscript (not published): material kept as a record

Figure and section numbers in this table refer to that manuscript and its Supplementary Material (SM).

The data behind every plotted curve of the spin paper and of the earlier kernels manuscript are in `plot_data/spin/` and `plot_data/kernels/`. `LIMITATIONS.md` states what each numerical check does and does not establish, including the sampling of the $\Phi$ grid.
